title: Geometrical Meaning of Hessian in Image
---

You may heard tons of corner detectors like FÃ¶rstner corner detector, Harris methods, laplacian of gaussian, etc. Most of them are leveraging gradient of image and hessians of image to capture local features, until the recent deep learning technique which use convolution methods.
