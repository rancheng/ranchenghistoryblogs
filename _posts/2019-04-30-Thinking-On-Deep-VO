title: Towards Deep Learning augumented Visual Odometry
---

Visual SLAM is already a well defined problem and has been largely explored. Many powerful algorithms use traditional geometrical
methods can achieve very high precision yet keep a reasonable speed. However, there's still some corner left to explore...

For example: camera motion blur, repeated texture and low texture localization challenges, direct methods in auto-exposure, light
source independent tracking...

Here I list several aspect that can be upgrade by deep learning modules:

 - [ ] keypoint anchor selection (initialization | front end)
 - [x] PnP data association
 - [ ] Scale solve
 - [ ] Absolute Pose solve
 - [x] backend optimization (BA, or solve Hessian)
 - [ ] Point Registration on revisiting
 - [ ] Loop closure
 - [ ] Graph representation
 
 checked boxes are managed and well explored aspects, some good papers are already published about them, will post the links later on.
