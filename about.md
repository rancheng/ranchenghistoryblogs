I'm a robotics researcher, with experience on visual SLAM, deep learning and reinforcement learning.

Currently working at Center for Intelligent Machines, McGill University, as CS M.S. candidate & Research Assistant of Professor [Gregory Dudek](https://www.cim.mcgill.ca/~dudek/), **looking for Ph.D in Robotics, Vision, and Learning**.
